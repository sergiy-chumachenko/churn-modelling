Bank Customer Churn Modelling using Artificial Neural Networks ()

The story: A bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. Here is a 10.000 records dataset to investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon.


About Dataset

This is the dataset used in the section "ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)" of the Udemy course from Kirill Eremenko (Data Scientist & Forex Systems Expert) and Hadelin de Ponteves (Data Scientist), called Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science. The dataset is very useful for beginners of Machine Learning, and a simple playground where to compare several techniques/skills.
